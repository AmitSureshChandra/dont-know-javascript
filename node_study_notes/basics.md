# Defination of NodeJS

- JS on your backend server (simple words)
- instructor who instructs VM to execute JS code
- wrapper around a VM like V8 with built-in modules providing rich features through easy to use async APIs

# Why Node ? 

- wrapper around V8
- built-in modules (fs, http, crypto, zip etc)
- Async APIs (no threads)
- C++ addons
- Debugger & other utilities
- NPM
- module dependency manager
    - commonjs module
    - ECMA module 

# Cons

- diff way of think
- picking good from many (NPM)
- small packages
