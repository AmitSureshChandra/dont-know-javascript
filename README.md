# dont-know-javascript
Javascript is one of the most dynamic &amp; mostly unpredictable language. In this repo I am going to maintain various things available in it

# Package from github 

eg. https://github.com/expressjs/express

to install :  `npm i expressjs/express#4.14.4`

# esm npm package for ECMA module node 10.x or older

for `10.x` or `older` we can use `esm` npm package for ECMA module. Below `-r` stands for load module before executing script

sample : `node -r esm code.js`

# node built-in debugging

- to debug run `node --inspect-brk file_name.js`
- in chrome open `chrome://inspect`

# Node popularity 

- JS Full Stack
- Non-blocking Event-driven
- Virtual Machine
- Single Threaded
