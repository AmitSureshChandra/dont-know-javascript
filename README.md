# dont-know-javascript
Javascript is one of the most dynamic &amp; mostly unpredictable language. In this repo I am going to maintain various things available in it

# Package from github 

eg. https://github.com/expressjs/express

to install :  `npm i expressjs/express`

# esm npm package (for 10.x or older)

for `10.x` or `older` we can use `esm` npm package for ECMA module. Below `-r` stands for load module before executing script

sample : `node -r esm code.js`
